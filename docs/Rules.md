# About

Kaktus is a card game where the players try to earn the lowest score over the course of multiple turns. The game is played by 2 to 6 players using a 40 cards deck (a 52 standard deck without 8s, 9s nor 10s).

## Deal

Each player is dealt four face-down cards. After dealing, players may peak at any 2 of their own cards. The remaining cards form the stockpile, from which the top card is taken to start the discard pile.

## Scores

The card scoring is as follows:

- King: 0 points.
- Ace: 1 point.
- Jack: 10 points.
- Queen: 10 points.
- All others have a value equal to their name, e.g. Two values 2 points, Three values 3 points, etc.

Suits have no influence in score nor in any other aspect of the game.

## Play

All players are randomly assigned a number starting from 1 in the beginning of the game to decide the order of the turns.

The first cycle starts with Player One and will follow in increasing order (Player Two, then Player Three, etc) until there's no next player, turning back to Player One and restarting the cycle.

During their turn players must draw a card and, before passing the turn to the next player, they have the option to call "Kaktus".

When the draw pile gets empty, the discard one is shuffled, forming a new draw pile. Again, the top card from the new one is taken and turned up to start a new discard pile.

### Drawing cards

There are two ways for drawing cards, either:

- Pick a card from the draw pile, and either keep it (one of their own cards must be discarded) or discard it (If it's a power card, its effect will be activated)
- Or do a "NEED TO FIND A NAME FOR THIS"

#### Power cards

When drawing, players might pick up a Power Card. Those are cards that, when picked up from the draw pile, have a special effect. Players must use its effect if they decided to discard it in the same turn they have drawn it.

They don't have any effect if found among the face-down cards or picked up from the discard pile. After use, they are immediately put into the discard pile.

The power cards have each the following effect:

- Six: The player can peak at one card of their own.
- Seven: The player can peak at one card from another player.
- Jack: The player can swap one card of their own with one from another player.

#### NEED TO FIND A NAME FOR THIS

When a player calls "THIS", they will turn face-up two of their cards that they believe are equal (share the name, not the suit).

- If the cards are equal the player can pick up the uppermost card in the discard pile, and then discard the two equal cards. This is the only way to reduce the number of cards in one's hand, as well as the only way to pick up cards from the discard pile.
- If instead the cards are not equal the player must pick up a new card from the draw pile that cannot be discarded in the current turn. This the only way to increase the number of cards in one's hand.

### Calling "Kaktus"

When a player call "Kaktus", the other players each get one more turn and then everyone has to turn their hidden cards face-up, and lay down the cards from their hands. The player with the lowest score wins.
